# Tarottrpg

This is just a little app I'm making with ideas from my siblings. Primarily I am just trying to get experience with C++ in preparation for my new job.

Uses SFML for the GUI.

One day hopefully vcpkg as the package manager should make it relatively easy to make builds for both windows and linux. We'll see, that sounds really tricky.
